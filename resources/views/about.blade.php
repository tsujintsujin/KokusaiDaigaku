            Mindanao Kokusai Daigaku is a tertiary educational institution of the Philippine Nikkei
            Jin Kai in Davao City, Philippines. The College building was constructed in the year 2001
            through the funding and generosity of the late Mr. Tatsuo Uchida (who died last May 2016), a
            past President of the Japan-Philippine Volunteer Association (JPVA). The MKD edifice serves
            as a legacy for his wife, the late Ayako Uchida who died in 1999.

            MKD commenced its operation in the year 2002, with the strong support and assistance
            coming from the JPVA headed by the President at the time, Mr. Masataka Ajiro, who helped
            significantly in the establishment of the College and in the crafting of the school’s philosophy
            and basic principles.

            and become a new bridge between the two nations. The establishment of MKD served as a
